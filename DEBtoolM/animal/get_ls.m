  %% Syntax
  % [ls, lj, lp, lb, info] = <../get_ls *get_ls*>(p, f, lb0)
  
  %% Description
  % Obtains scaled length at start and end of acceleration at constant food density. 
  % Isomorph, but V1-morph between vHs and vHj, with vHb> vHs> vHj > vHp.
  % If scaled length at birth (third input) is not specified, it is computed (using automatic initial estimate); 
  % if it is specified. however, is it just copied to the (third) output.
  %
  % Input
  %
  % * p: 7-vector with parameters: g, k, l_T, v_H^b, v_H^s, v_H^j, v_H^p
  % * f: optional scalar with scaled functional responses (default 1)
  % * lb0: optional scalar with scaled length at birth
  %  
  % Output
  %
  % * ls: scalar with scaled length at start of V1-stage
  % * lj: scalar with scaled length at end of V1-stage
  % * lp: scalar with scaled length at puberty (start reprod of iso-stage)
  % * lb: scalar with scaled length at birth (start feeding of iso-stage)
  % * info: indicator equals 1 if successful, 0 otherwise
  
  %% Remarks
  % The start of the V1-morphic stage is marked by an event called s, and the end by an event called j. 
  % This routine obtaines scaled length at s, ls, and j, lj given scaled muturity at s, cHs, and j, vHj. 
  % The theory behind get_ls, is discussed in the <http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Kooy2010_c.pdf comments to DEB3>. 
  % Scaled length l = L/ L_m with L_m = kap {p_Am}/ [p_M] where {p_Am} is of embryo
  % {p_Am} and v increase between maturities v_H^s and v_H^j till
  % {p_Am} sM and v sM with sM = l_j/ l_s after metamorphosis after metamorphosis l increases from l_j till l_i = f l_j/ l_s - l_T
  % l can thus be larger than 1.
