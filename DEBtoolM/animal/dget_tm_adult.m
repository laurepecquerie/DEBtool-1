  % routine called by get_tm
  % l: scalar with scaled length l = L/L_m
  % x: 4-vector with state variables, see below
  % dx: d/dt x

  % unpack state variables

  h  = x(2); % hazard
  S  = x(3); % survival probability
  % cS = x(4); % cumulative survival probability
  % uE = f * l^3/ g; % scaled reserve
 
  % derivatives with respect to time
  r = (f - lT - l)/ l/ (f/ g + g); % spec growth rate in scaled time

  dS = - S * h;
  dcS = S;
 
  % pack derivatives with respect to length
  dx = [dq; dh; dS; dcS]/ dl;
