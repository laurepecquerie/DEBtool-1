%% The paper describes the nutrient and organic matter turnover in a 
%% homogeneous system that is closed for mass and open for energy. 
%% It also considers an one-dimensional spatial structure, with a light 
%% gradient. The rules for uptake and use of resources imply the 
%% development of particular profiles for systems's components.
