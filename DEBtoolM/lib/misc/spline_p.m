  %% Description
  %  Cubic splines are piece-wise cubic polynomials between knots, 
  %   and linear outside the knots, such that the spline is differentiable everywhere. 
  %  Natural cubic splines have a second derivative equal to zero at the first and last knot; 
  %   the first derivative is differentable everywhere, the second derivative is continuous, 
  %   and the third derivative is piecewise constant and not continuous. 
  %  Left and/or right clamped cubic splines have a prescribed first derivative at the first and/or last knot; 
  %   the second derivative at these knots is (generally) not equal to zero, while it is outside the knot-range.
  %  Calculates the ordinates and the first three derivatives of a cubic spline, given abcissa and knot coordinates. 
  %  The spline is interpolating, see knot for obtaining knot coordinates of a smoothing spline. 
  %  The natural cubic spline is selected by default, but it can optionally be clamped left and/or right. 
  %
  %% Input
  %  x: n-vector with ordinates
  %  knots: (nk,2)-matrix with coordinates of knots; we must have nk > 3
  %         knots(:,1) must be ascending
  %   the period starts and ends at knot(1,1), knot(1,end)
  %   knot(1,2) = dy(x(1))/ dy; assumption y(1) = y(end)
  %
  %% Output
  %  y: n-vector with spline values: y(x)
  %  dy: n-vector with first derivatives of spline
  %  ddy: n-vector with second derivatives of spline
  %  dddy; n-vector with third derivatives of spline
  %
  %% Remarks
  %  See ispline for integration, rspline for roots, espline for local extremes. 
  %
  %% Example of use 
  %  x = (1:10)'; y = 3*(x+.1*rand(10,1)).^2;: k = knot(0.5+[0 2 5 7]',[x,y]); 
  %  [Y, dY, ddY, dddY] = spline(x,k); iY = ispline(x,k); rspline(k,5)
  %% Example of the use of clamps
  %  Y = spline(x,k,0) (left clamp); Y = spline(x,k,[],0) (right clamp); Y = spline(x,k,0,0) (left and right clamp); 
  %  See mydata_spline and mydata_smooth for further illustrations.
