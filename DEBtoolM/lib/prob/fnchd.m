  %% Description
  %  Obtains the expected value of Fisher's non-central hypergeometric distribution, 
  %  its appoximation, and the correponding mean of the binomial distribution for small smaples sizes. 
  %
  %% Input
  %  m0: number of objects of type 0
  %  m1: number of objects of type 1
  %  n: number of objects in the sample
  %  b: odds ratio for objects of type 0, relative to that of type 1
  %
  %% Output
  %  E: mean of Fisher's non-central hypergeometric distribution
  %  F: an approximation of the mean based on the modus
  %  G: the mean of the corresponding binomial distr for large m0 and m1
  %
  %% Example of use
  %  fnchd(12, 5, 3, 1.8)
  
  %% Code
  if m0 + m1 < n % sample size cannot exceed the number of objects
    E = []; F = [], G = [];
    return
  end
  
  y = max(0,n - m1):min(n,m0); % support
  E = bincoeff(m0, y) .* bincoeff(m1, n - y) .* b .^ y;
  E = sum(E .* y)/ sum(E);
  
  B = n - m1 - (m0 + n) * b;
  F = - 2 * m0 * n * b / (B - sqrt(B * B - 4 * (b - 1) * m0 * n * b));
  
  G = n * m0 * b/ (m0 * b + m1);
