%% The paper describes the trophic relationships between autothrophs and
%% herbivores, and how herbivory can make a smooth transition to
%% symbiosis. The basis is that herbivores consume the structure and,
%% more important, the reserves of the autotrophs. Autotrophs also have
%% to excrete some reserves in the environment, which can be taken up by
%% the herbivores as well. Stoichiometric constraints and conversion
%% efficiencies dominate the relationships between the partners.

%% Autotroph and heterotroph in a chemostat
%%
%% Inorganic carbon and light are not limiting.
%% The inflowing medium has organic substrate (X) and/or nitrogen (N, ammonia);
%%   the specific throughput rate of the chemostat is called h
%% Initially hardly any autotrophs (VA), heterotrophs (VH) or hydrocarbon (CH)
%%   are present in the chemostat, and the concentrations
%%   nitrogen and substrate equal that in the feed;
%% Substrate contains nitrogen, but this is not available for the autotroph
%% The autotroph (VA) excretes nitrogen (N) and carbohydrate (CH), and
%%   consumes nitrogen (N)
%% The heterotroph (VH) excretes nitrogen (N), and consumes, apart from the
%%   autotroph (VA), nitrogen (N), carbohydrate (CH) and substrate (X);
%% no faeces is produced, so all wastes are mineralized instantaneously
%% The autotroph has structure (VA), nitrogen-reserves (EN),
%%   and carbohydrate-reserves (EC);
%%   reserve-densities: mEN = mass EN/ mass VA; mEC = mass EC/ mass VA
%% The heterotroph has structure (VH), and reserves (E);
%%   reserve density: mE = mass E/ mass VH
%% Both auto- and heterotrophs are taken to be V1-morphs,
%%   with negigible aging
